description: |
  Raven is a de novo assembler optimized for long uncorrected reads (ONT / PacBio).
  It prints contigs to stdout (FASTA) and can optionally emit a GFA graph.
  
  This app wraps Raven with common flags and saves:
    • A KBase Assembly object (FASTA)
    • (Optional) the GFA in the report
